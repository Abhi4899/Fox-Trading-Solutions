Internship task

I have used openpyxl


In my program you need to enter the name of the city, temperature format (C/F) and update
requirement (0/1) manually.
According to your input values, the specified city temperature will be refreshed every
second.
To stop the program from refreshing you have to enter x. For this the program will ask to
enter a letter every 60 refreshment. If you enter ‘x’, the program will stop.



Please note that the number of request from API is
limited to 60 requests per minute.
